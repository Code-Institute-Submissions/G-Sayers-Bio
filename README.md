  * Easily **download a CV** for comparison with other candidates. 
* As a **Potential Employer for a Leadership Role** I want to;

  * **Download Gemma's CV** if user is a **potential employer**. 
  * **Connect with Gemma on social media** if user is a potential employer, collaborator, or client. 


### User Reqirements and Expectations 
---
* Responsive design for accessibility across a range of devices.
* Minimal design for easy navigation.
* Easy to contact Gemma directly or through social media links.
### Design choices 
---
* Layout & Wireframes
  * I have included two sets of wireframes as initially I started to build the site intended to go across separate pages, but then decided with my mentor that a single-page site would be a much better user-experience for the purposes of this project.  Final wireframes can be seen **here**, and the originals **here**. 
* Colours
  * I researched what the colour trends are for 2021 as I want my site to look current and appealing, and was inspired by some of the themes in [99designs](https://en.99designs.it/blog/trends/color-trends/). I then used [colourmind.io](http://colormind.io/) to put my colours into a pallet for consistent use on the website.  You can find my colour inspiration here. and the colour pallet below. [colour-pallet](../colours/colour-pallet.png)
* Icons 
  * Icons are a great way to signal to the user in a succinct way without being too wordy.  I have used icons from Font Awesome (link) across my about and skills section. 
* Imagery  
   * I have used my own photograph for the header jumbotron to ad a personal edge to the site, however for the portfolio slides, I have used stock images from Shutterstock (link) as I wanted a clean, professional look and sadly my photography is not up to much! 
* Fonts
  *  I have used the Montserrat font across the whole site and used Sans Serif and the fail-safe incase of any loading issues.  Monserrat is a simple clean font, easy to read and stylish. 

### Technologies Used
---
  * Languages;
    *  [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    *  [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
  * Libraries, Frameworks & Resources;
    *  [Bootstrap 4.5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) was used 
    *  [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    * Google Fonts
    * Font Awesome
    * jQuery
    * Git 
    * GitHub
    * Balsamiq
    * Colourmind.io was used to put together my colour pallet, using the inspo images I sourced from;
    * [99designs](https://en.99designs.it/blog/trends/color-trends/)
    * [Apple Photobooth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photo-booth/id1208226939) was used to make my self-portrait a little more appealing!
    *  [Google Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) has been invaluable for solving issues and bugs and testing responsiveness. 

### Features
---
* Included in current deployment;
  * PDF CV and a function to download.
  * Contact button to open email directly.
  * I have included interactive Hover Elements for better UX.
* Future implementations;
  * I would like to upgrade the colours as I feel these did not come across as well as I anticipated based on the pallet. 
  * I removed the form from the original design as I thought it lengthned the contact process too much - I may consider ways to add this in with UX taken into account.
